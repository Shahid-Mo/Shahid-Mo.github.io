So, what are AI agents, and who are thy supposed to replace, and whats all this doom and gloom about agents taking our jobs, so before you head for the hills and take up farming (like our forefathers), like the ai's not comming for that job, Lets look at a high level oveview of what an agent is?

So you can think of an ideal agent, like your real estate agemt, when you want to sell your house, your Agent puts up your house on the market (for our example sakes, on the internet makrketplace, negotiates with potential clients, and finally gets your deal done.)

Think of an ai agent in the same way, you would input your query in the computer that i wnat to sell my house, these are some picture, and the agent is off to the races, it would make an attractive flier for your house, using photshop, or any other tool, and then write a small mock up like "Built in 1987, ..." then post the add on zillo. Wait for potential customers to reach out and then negotiates an open house, (probably wiht the help of the boston dynamics robots emoji), then show the house, if the buyer is satisfied, contacts a lawer agent or bot, to draft up all the legal work, and finally send you the documentat for your final signature, and this real estate agent wouldnt probably wont take a 5% cut of your property as an added bonus.

So after painting such a preety/gloomy picture, lest look under the hood how some of these agents work.

What exactly an LLM agent is ?

You might have interacted with agents already (in the traditional sense), if a player on pubgi or fortnite is not playing up to your insane standards they are called a bot, (might me bots)

So lets also take a historical view of agents, thay would like to interact with our computer, 

Below is an excerpt from a talk andrej karparthy gave last summer at a hackothon.

# Convexity: Key Properties and Derivations

Convexity is a fundamental concept in optimization and plays a crucial role in the design and analysis of algorithms. In this post, we'll delve into three important properties of convex functions:

1. **Local Minima Are Global Minima**
2. **Below Sets of Convex Functions Are Convex**
3. **Convexity and Second Derivatives**

We'll provide detailed explanations and derivations for each property, enhancing our understanding of convex functions and their significance in optimization.

## 1. Local Minima Are Global Minima

### **Introduction**

One of the most powerful features of convex functions is that any local minimum is also a global minimum. This property simplifies optimization significantly because it eliminates the concern of getting trapped in suboptimal local minimaâ€”a common issue in non-convex optimization.

### **Definition of Convex Function**

Let $$ f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $$ be a function defined on a convex set $$ X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n $$. The function $$ f $$ is **convex** if, for all $$ x, y \in X $$ and $$ \lambda \in [0, 1] $$:

$$
f(\lambda x + (1 - \lambda)y) \leq \lambda f(x) + (1 - \lambda) f(y)
$$

This inequality essentially states that the function lies below or on the straight line (chord) connecting $$ f(x) $$ and $$ f(y) $$.

### **Theorem Statement**

**Theorem:** *If $$ f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $$ is a convex function on a convex set $$ X $$, then any local minimum of $$ f $$ is also a global minimum.*

### **Proof**

We will prove this theorem by contradiction.

**Assumption:**

Suppose $$ x^* \in X $$ is a local minimum of $$ f $$, but **not** a global minimum. This means there exists some $$ x_0 \in X $$ such that:

$$
f(x_0) < f(x^*)
$$

Since $$ x^* $$ is a local minimum, there exists a neighborhood around $$ x^* $$, say $$ B_\delta(x^*) $$ (an open ball of radius $$ \delta $$), such that for all $$ x \in B_\delta(x^*) \cap X $$:

$$
f(x^*) \leq f(x)
$$

**Constructing a Contradiction:**

1. **Convex Combination:**

   Since $$ X $$ is convex, the line segment between $$ x^* $$ and $$ x_0 $$ lies entirely within $$ X $$. Consider points along this segment defined by:

   $$
   x_\lambda = \lambda x^* + (1 - \lambda) x_0, \quad \lambda \in [0, 1]
   $$

2. **Choosing $$ \lambda $$:**

   Select $$ \lambda $$ sufficiently close to 1 such that $$ x_\lambda \in B_\delta(x^*) $$. Specifically, choose:

   $$
   \lambda = 1 - \epsilon, \quad \text{where } \epsilon > 0 \text{ is small enough}
   $$

3. **Applying Convexity:**

   Using the convexity of $$ f $$:

   $$
   \begin{align*}
   f(x_\lambda) &= f(\lambda x^* + (1 - \lambda) x_0) \\
   &\leq \lambda f(x^*) + (1 - \lambda) f(x_0) \\
   &= (1 - \epsilon) f(x^*) + \epsilon f(x_0)
   \end{align*}
   $$

4. **Since $$ f(x_0) < f(x^*) $$:**

   $$
   f(x_\lambda) < (1 - \epsilon) f(x^*) + \epsilon f(x^*) = f(x^*)
   $$

   This inequality arises because $$ f(x_0) < f(x^*) $$, so the weighted average is less than $$ f(x^*) $$.

5. **Contradiction:**

   We have found a point $$ x_\lambda \in B_\delta(x^*) \cap X $$ such that $$ f(x_\lambda) < f(x^*) $$, contradicting the assumption that $$ x^* $$ is a local minimum.

**Conclusion:**

Our assumption that $$ x^* $$ is not a global minimum must be false. Therefore, any local minimum of a convex function is also a global minimum.

### **Implications**

- **Optimization Simplicity:** In convex optimization problems, any algorithm that converges to a local minimum has effectively found the global minimum.
- **Algorithm Design:** This property allows for the development of efficient optimization algorithms without worrying about local minima traps.

### **Examples**

1. **Quadratic Function:**

   Consider $$ f(x) = (x - 3)^2 $$.

   - **Convexity:** The second derivative $$ f''(x) = 2 > 0 $$ confirms convexity.
   - **Minimum:** Setting $$ f'(x) = 0 $$ yields $$ x^* = 3 $$.
   - **Global Minimum:** Since $$ f $$ is convex, $$ x^* = 3 $$ is the global minimum.

2. **Exponential Function:**

   $$ f(x) = e^x $$.

   - **Convexity:** $$ f''(x) = e^x > 0 $$.
   - **Behavior:** As $$ x \rightarrow -\infty $$, $$ f(x) \rightarrow 0 $$, but $$ f(x) $$ never reaches a minimum value in $$ \mathbb{R} $$.
   - **No Minimum:** This illustrates that a convex function may not attain a minimum within its domain.

## 2. Below Sets of Convex Functions Are Convex

### **Introduction**

Sublevel sets (also known as **below sets** or **sublevel sets**) of convex functions inherit convexity from the function itself. This property is vital in constraint optimization, where feasible regions are often defined by such sets.

### **Definition of Below Set**

Given a function $$ f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $$, the **below set** at level $$ b $$ is:

$$
S_b = \{ x \in X \mid f(x) \leq b \}
$$

### **Theorem Statement**

**Theorem:** *If $$ f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $$ is a convex function on a convex set $$ X $$, then the below set $$ S_b $$ is a convex set for any $$ b \in \mathbb{R} $$.*

### **Proof**

To prove that $$ S_b $$ is convex, we must show that for any $$ x_1, x_2 \in S_b $$ and any $$ \lambda \in [0, 1] $$, the point $$ x_\lambda = \lambda x_1 + (1 - \lambda) x_2 $$ also belongs to $$ S_b $$.

**Given:**

- $$ x_1, x_2 \in S_b \implies f(x_1) \leq b $$ and $$ f(x_2) \leq b $$.
- $$ \lambda \in [0, 1] $$.
- $$ x_\lambda = \lambda x_1 + (1 - \lambda) x_2 \in X $$ (since $$ X $$ is convex).

**Using Convexity:**

$$
\begin{align*}
f(x_\lambda) &= f(\lambda x_1 + (1 - \lambda) x_2) \\
&\leq \lambda f(x_1) + (1 - \lambda) f(x_2) \\
&\leq \lambda b + (1 - \lambda) b = b
\end{align*}
$$

**Conclusion:**

Since $$ f(x_\lambda) \leq b $$, $$ x_\lambda \in S_b $$. Therefore, $$ S_b $$ is convex.

### **Implications**

- **Feasible Regions:** In optimization problems with convex constraints (e.g., $$ f(x) \leq b $$), the feasible region is convex.
- **Constraint Handling:** Convexity of sublevel sets simplifies the analysis and solution of constrained optimization problems.

### **Examples**

1. **Norm Constraint:**

   $$ f(x) = \| x \|_2 $$, $$ S_1 = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid \| x \|_2 \leq 1 \} $$.

   - **Convexity of $$ f $$:** The norm function is convex.
   - **Below Set:** $$ S_1 $$ is the closed unit ball in $$ \mathbb{R}^n $$, a convex set.

2. **Affine Function:**

   $$ f(x) = a^T x + b $$, where $$ a \in \mathbb{R}^n $$, $$ b \in \mathbb{R} $$.

   - **Convexity of $$ f $$:** Affine functions are convex.
   - **Below Set:** $$ S_b = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid a^T x + b \leq c \} $$ is a half-space, which is convex.

### **Visualization**

Consider a convex function $$ f(x) $$ and a horizontal line $$ y = b $$. The sublevel set $$ S_b $$ consists of all points $$ x $$ such that $$ f(x) $$ lies below or on this line.

In the figure, the blue region represents $$ S_b $$. Any convex combination of points within this region remains within the region, illustrating its convexity.

## 3. Convexity and Second Derivatives

### **Introduction**

The relationship between convexity and second derivatives provides a practical criterion for determining the convexity of twice-differentiable functions. In one dimension, convexity is linked to the sign of the second derivative, while in higher dimensions, it involves the positive semidefiniteness of the Hessian matrix.

### **One-Dimensional Case**

**Theorem:** *A twice-differentiable function $$ f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $$ is convex on an interval $$ I $$ if and only if $$ f''(x) \geq 0 $$ for all $$ x \in I $$.*

#### **Proof**

**(Necessity)**

Assume $$ f $$ is convex on $$ I $$.

1. **Midpoint Convexity:**

   For any $$ x, h $$ such that $$ x, x \pm h \in I $$:

   $$
   f(x) \leq \frac{1}{2} f(x - h) + \frac{1}{2} f(x + h)
   $$

2. **Second Difference:**

   Rearranging:

   $$
   f(x + h) + f(x - h) - 2f(x) \geq 0
   $$

3. **Limit as $$ h \rightarrow 0 $$:**

   The second derivative is:

   $$
   f''(x) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + h) + f(x - h) - 2f(x)}{h^2} \geq 0
   $$

**(Sufficiency)**

Assume $$ f''(x) \geq 0 $$ for all $$ x \in I $$.

1. **Non-Decreasing First Derivative:**

   Since $$ f''(x) \geq 0 $$, $$ f'(x) $$ is non-decreasing on $$ I $$.

2. **Applying Mean Value Theorem:**

   For any $$ x, y \in I $$ with $$ x < y $$, there exists $$ c \in (x, y) $$ such that:

   $$
   f'(c) = \frac{f(y) - f(x)}{y - x}
   $$

3. **Convexity Condition:**

   Since $$ f' $$ is non-decreasing:

   $$
   f'(x) \leq f'(c) \leq f'(y)
   $$

   Thus, the secant line between $$ (x, f(x)) $$ and $$ (y, f(y)) $$ lies above the tangent lines at $$ x $$ and $$ y $$, satisfying the convexity condition.

### **Multidimensional Case**

**Theorem:** *A twice-differentiable function $$ f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $$ is convex on a convex set $$ X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n $$ if and only if its Hessian matrix $$ \nabla^2 f(x) $$ is positive semidefinite (PSD) for all $$ x \in X $$.*

#### **Definitions**

- **Hessian Matrix:** The matrix of second-order partial derivatives:

  $$
  \nabla^2 f(x) = \left[ \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} \right]_{i,j=1}^n
  $$

- **Positive Semidefinite Matrix:** A symmetric matrix $$ H $$ is PSD if:

  $$
  z^T H z \geq 0 \quad \text{for all } z \in \mathbb{R}^n
  $$

#### **Proof**

**(Necessity)**

Assume $$ f $$ is convex on $$ X $$.

1. **Directional Second Derivative:**

   For any $$ x \in X $$ and any $$ z \in \mathbb{R}^n $$ such that $$ x + tz \in X $$ for small $$ t $$:

   Define $$ \phi(t) = f(x + tz) $$.

2. **Convexity of $$ \phi(t) $$:**

   Since $$ f $$ is convex, $$ \phi(t) $$ is convex in $$ t $$.

3. **Second Derivative of $$ \phi(t) $$:**

   $$
   \phi''(0) = z^T \nabla^2 f(x) z \geq 0
   $$

   Therefore, $$ \nabla^2 f(x) $$ is PSD.

**(Sufficiency)**

Assume $$ \nabla^2 f(x) $$ is PSD for all $$ x \in X $$.

1. **Convexity Along Lines:**

   For any $$ x, y \in X $$ and $$ \lambda \in [0,1] $$, consider:

   $$
   \gamma(\lambda) = x + \lambda(y - x)
   $$

2. **Function $$ \phi(\lambda) = f(\gamma(\lambda)) $$:**

   The second derivative is:

   $$
   \phi''(\lambda) = (y - x)^T \nabla^2 f(\gamma(\lambda)) (y - x) \geq 0
   $$

   Thus, $$ \phi $$ is convex in $$ \lambda $$.

3. **Applying Convexity of $$ \phi $$:**

   $$
   f(\lambda x + (1 - \lambda) y) = \phi(\lambda) \leq \lambda \phi(1) + (1 - \lambda) \phi(0) = \lambda f(y) + (1 - \lambda) f(x)
   $$

   Therefore, $$ f $$ is convex.

### **Implications**

- **Testing Convexity:** Checking the positive semidefiniteness of the Hessian is a practical method for verifying the convexity of twice-differentiable functions.
- **Optimization Algorithms:** Knowledge of the Hessian's properties informs algorithm selection (e.g., Newton's method relies on the Hessian).

### **Examples**

1. **Quadratic Function:**

   $$ f(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^T Q x + b^T x + c $$, where $$ Q $$ is a symmetric matrix.

   - **Hessian:** $$ \nabla^2 f(x) = Q $$.
   - **Convexity:** If $$ Q $$ is PSD, then $$ f $$ is convex.

2. **Log-Sum-Exp Function:**

   $$ f(x) = \log\left( \sum_{i=1}^n e^{a_i^T x} \right) $$.

   - **Hessian:** The Hessian $$ \nabla^2 f(x) $$ is PSD because $$ f $$ is a composition of convex functions.
   - **Convexity:** $$ f $$ is convex.

### **Visualization in Two Dimensions**

Consider $$ f(x) = x^T x = x_1^2 + x_2^2 $$.

- **Hessian:** $$ \nabla^2 f(x) = 2I $$, where $$ I $$ is the identity matrix.
- **Eigenvalues:** All eigenvalues are 2, which are positive.
- **Contour Plot:**

  ![Contour Plot of Convex Function](https://i.imgur.com/syP47Pl.png)

  The contours are concentric circles, illustrating the convexity of $$ f $$.

## **Conclusion**

Understanding these properties of convex functions enhances our ability to analyze and solve optimization problems effectively:

- **Local vs. Global Minima:** Convex functions guarantee that any local minimum is a global minimum, simplifying optimization.
- **Convex Sublevel Sets:** The convexity of below sets aids in defining and working with feasible regions in constrained optimization.
- **Second Derivatives and Convexity:** The relationship between the second derivative (or Hessian) and convexity provides a practical criterion for verifying convexity.

By leveraging these properties, we can design efficient algorithms and gain deeper insights into the structure of optimization problems.
