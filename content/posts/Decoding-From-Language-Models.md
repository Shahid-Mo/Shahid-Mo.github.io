Welcome to TensorTunes, where we explore the fascinating intersection of mathematics, music, and machine learning. Our goal is to uncover the hidden harmonies in data and sound, using the power of algorithms and signal processing.

Here's a simple example of how we might use LaTeX to express a musical concept mathematically:

The frequency $f$ of a note in the equal-tempered scale is given by:

$$
f = 440 \cdot 2^{\frac{n}{12}}
$$

Where $n$ is the number of semitones away from A4 (440 Hz).

In future posts, we'll dive deeper into topics like:

1. Fourier transforms and their applications in audio processing
2. Neural networks for music generation
3. Mathematical models of rhythm and meter
4. The geometry of musical scales and chords

Stay tuned for more exciting explorations at the crossroads of math and music!
