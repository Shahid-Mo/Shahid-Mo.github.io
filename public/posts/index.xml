      <description>A quick refresher on Autoregressive text generation Autoregressive language models generate text through a sequential process of predicting one token at a time. The model takes a sequence of tokens $ \lbrace y \rbrace _{&amp;lt;t} $ as input and outputs a new token $ \hat{y_t} $. This process repeats iteratively, with each newly generated token becoming part of the input for the subsequent prediction.
At each time step $ t $, the model computes a vector of scores $ \mathbf{S} \in \mathbb{R}^V $, where $ V $ is the size of the vocabulary.</description>

      <description>Introduction to Quantization Whether you&amp;rsquo;re an AI enthusiast looking to run large language models (LLMs) locally on your personal device, a multi-billion-dollar startup aiming to serve a state-of-the-art model to customers, or someone wanting to fine-tune models like LLaMA or Flux, quantization is a technique you need to understand.
Quantization can broadly be categorized into two types:
Quantization Aware Training (QAT): Integrates quantization into the training process, allowing the model to adapt to reduced precision during training.</description>

      <description>Introduction
Quantization is a crucial technique in deep learning that reduces the memory footprint and computational requirements of neural networks by representing weights and activations with lower-precision numerical formats. This is particularly important when deploying large models on devices with limited resources. However, quantizing a neural network without significantly degrading its performance is challenging.
The GPTQ (Gradient Post-Training Quantization) algorithm is a method designed to efficiently quantize large-scale neural networks, such as those used in natural language processing, while maintaining high accuracy.</description>
