    Title: "Welcome to TensorTunes ðŸŽ¶"
    Content: |
      Hi, Iâ€™m **Shahid**, currently pursuing my master's in Artificial Intelligence at the **University at Buffalo** ðŸŽ“ (graduating December 2024). 

      This blog is where I compile my notes on **Large Language Models (LLMs)** ðŸ¤–, drawn from papers, videos, and other resources.

      Inspired by **Albert Einsteinâ€™s** words, *"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough,"* I break down complex concepts to refine my understanding ðŸ§ .

      Iâ€™m also actively seeking **full-time opportunities** to apply these skills in real-world applications ðŸ’¼.
