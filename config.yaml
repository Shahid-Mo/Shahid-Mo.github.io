      "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." — Albert Einstein
      
      Exploring the harmony of mathematics and music through the lens of machine learning and signal processing. 🎵

      TensorTunes is where I document my journey through different signal processing techniques and how they relate to machine learning models. 🧑‍💻✨

      Join me as I explore various methods to create soundscapes using AI and learn how mathematical models influence the way we perceive audio. 🎧🤖
